  Authentication
  The provider supports two authWhen using username/passwordentication methods:
  1. OAuth Application Credentials (recommended for production)

    organization_name = "built-in"
    application_name  = "app-built-in"
  }
  
  2. Admin Username/Password (convenient for development)
  
  provider "casdoor" {
    endpoint          = "https://casdoor.example.com"
    organization_name = "built-in"
    application_name  = "app-built-in"
    username          = "admin"
    password          = var.casdoor_admin_password
  }
  
  When using username/password, the provider will login and automatically fetch the application's OAuth credentials.

# casdoor Provider

The Casdoor provider allows you to manage Casdoor resources.

## Authentication

The provider supports two authWhen using username/passwordentication methods:

### 1. OAuth Application Credentials (recommended for production)

```hcl
provider "casdoor" {
  endpoint          = "https://casdoor.example.com"
  client_id         = "your-client-id"
  client_secret     = "your-client-secret"
  certificate       = file("path/to/cert.pem")
  organization_name = "built-in"
  application_name  = "app-built-in"
}
```

### 2. Admin Username/Password (convenient for development)

```hcl
provider "casdoor" {
  endpoint          = "https://casdoor.example.com"
  organization_name = "built-in"
  application_name  = "app-built-in"
  username          = "admin"
  password          = var.casdoor_admin_password
}
```

When using username/password, the provider will login and automatically fetch the application's OAuth credentials.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Authentication Method 1: OAuth Application Credentials (recommended for production)
provider "casdoor" {
  endpoint          = "https://casdoor.example.com"
  client_id         = "your-client-id"
  client_secret     = "your-client-secret"
  certificate       = file("path/to/certificate.pem")
  organization_name = "built-in"
  application_name  = "app-built-in"
}

# Authentication Method 2: Admin Username/Password (convenient for development)
# provider "casdoor" {
#   endpoint          = "https://casdoor.example.com"
#   organization_name = "built-in"
#   application_name  = "app-built-in"
#   username          = "admin"
#   password          = var.casdoor_admin_password
# }
